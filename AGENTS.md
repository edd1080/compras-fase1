# ADF Project Instructions

## Project Lifecycle Router

On every new session:

1. Read `.harness/manifest.yml` and `.harness/STATE.md`.
2. Read `.harness/HANDOFF.md` when it contains an active handoff.
3. Read only the lessons relevant to the current mode.
4. Route from lifecycle state:
   - `intake` → invoke `project-intake`.
   - active handoff → invoke `session-start`.
   - project ready with no feature → guide feature selection.
   - active feature → load its Spec Kit artifacts.

Inspect before asking the user for information. Never implement before Gate G4 and an explicit `GO`.

## Sources of Truth

- Agent rules: `AGENTS.md`
- Harness versions and ownership: `.harness/manifest.yml`
- Current global state: `.harness/STATE.md`
- Immediate continuity: `.harness/HANDOFF.md`
- Product requirements: approved documents under `docs/product/`
- Feature scope and execution: `specs/NNN-feature/`

Drafts, observations, and references do not silently become approved requirements.

## Gates

- G0 — Harness Integrity
- G1 — Project Intake
- G2 — Specification Ready
- G3 — Plan Ready
- G4 — Implementation Authorized
- G5 — Slice Verified
- G6 — Feature Closed

A successful validation is evidence, not human approval.

## Safety

- Never commit, push, deploy, publish, or mutate external systems without explicit authorization for that action.
- Preserve user-owned files and stop on unresolved conflicts.
- Keep the authorized diff minimal.
- Record verification evidence before declaring work complete.

Load detailed procedures from `.agents/skills/` only when relevant to the current lifecycle and task.
