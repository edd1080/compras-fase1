Run a read-only two-axis review from the fixed point supplied by the caller.

1. Standards: cite documented repository rules and label heuristic smells as judgment calls.
2. Spec: cite missing, partial, incorrect, or unrequested behavior against the approved source.
3. Keep both reports separate and order findings by severity within each axis.
4. End with counts, the worst finding per axis, and `Writes: none`.

Propose changes without applying them.
